 * (common separator), which UAX #9 rule W4 folds into the surrounding digits —
 * the whole amount stays one run and reads "2 499" in both directions. It is
 * also the correct French thousands separator, and never wraps.

 * between the Node server and the browser, which produces a hydration mismatch
 * on a string that renders inside the first viewport.
